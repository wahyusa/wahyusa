### Hi there 👋

# 🚨 Warning 🚨

Welcome to my GitHub! A digital landfill where projects go to die and my youth fades. Let’s get one thing straight: I’m not “experienced”—I’m just old 😜. Like, *really* old. Old enough to remember when AI is nothing.  

## 📊 Stats That Nobody Cares:
- **Years of Coding:** 9+ (use random programming languages and frameworks)
- **Projects Completed:** 1 (hellow world project) 
- **Lines of Code:** 10,000+ (mostly copy-pasted from Stack Overflow or AI Generated).  
- **Current Skill Level:** Expert at creating basic pragmatic CRUD without thinking much about other edge cases.
- Previously addicted to AI and vibe coding, now I have repented and returned to the right SWE path. 😇

## 🎯 My “Achievements”:
- **Code Monkey:** Randomly using programming languages and frameworks to do some random things.
- **Badge Collector:** Just because I am not best at least I have some badges.
- **Pinned Repositories:** I don't have any, but I can prove that I am old by this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/wahyusa/e34ed057bac98417b96556cb37933c52)
- **Open Source Contribution:** My first accepted open source contribution pull request actually just moving "period" to last sentence in [GitHub Docs](https://github.com/github/docs/commit/f50aaf6babbdc93f7f6a59119e33685d01cc9ce9) also I proud to be initial part of [Astro JS](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/4384) decision to use `npx` instead of `npm run`.

## 📈 Career Trajectory:
- **2013:** “I’m successfully creating Facebook phising site, hacked more than 10 victim including my friend”  
- **2017:** “I’m join GitHub because I think can host blog site free forever here”  
- **2018:** “Unemployeed”
- **2019 - 2023:** “Bachelor Degree but in COVID events”
- **2024:** “Manipulated by bootcamp and course seller”
- **2025:** “Getting old with no experience”
- **Friendly note:** Even though I'm getting old and don't work in the SWE field, I'm glad I can still afford my daily expenses and gacha game top up while keeping tech and programming as my hobbies 🤗 but of course I still try to get better job.

## 🔥 Hot Take:
If you’re looking for someone who’s “been there, done that,” you’ve come to the wrong place. I’ve been there, *tried* that, and then immediately forgot how it worked. My code is a chaotic mess of outdated libraries and questionable design choices. Dirty and pragmatic naive codes. But hey, at least I’m consistent!

Taylor Otwell once said Gen Z especially in Laravel field might not be able to do in depth backend development, they don't know or understand about cache, queue, databases and so on. Well, it was true! just like me. I don't know maybe people should give junior or intern a chance but with detailed workflow, gitflow, code review rules, convention and mentor. But I know most companies are just don't have time and resource to do that.

## 🤷 Wondering :
I waste many years to learn some random codes to fix my random needs and I got random knowledge and that was fun until I am getting old and need to get money.
