### Hi there 👋

# 🚨 Warning: This Profile is Under Construction (Like My Career) 🚨

Welcome to my GitHub! A digital landfill where projects go to die and my youth slowly fades. Let’s get one thing straight: I’m not “experienced”—I’m just old. Like, *really* old. Old enough to remember when JavaScript was just a funny name for a programming language, and Git was something you got stuck in trees.  

## 📊 Stats That Nobody Cares:
- **Years of Coding:** 10+ (but who’s counting? Oh right, my aching back.)  
- **Projects Completed:** 3 (two of which are “Hello World” clones).  
- **Lines of Code:** 10,000+ (mostly copy-pasted from Stack Overflow or AI Generated).  
- **Current Skill Level:** Expert at creating basic pragmatic CRUD without thinking much about other edge cases.

## 🎯 My “Achievements”:
- **Master of Inactivity:** I’ve perfected the art of staring at a blank screen for hours. It’s my superpower.  
- **Badge Collector:** Those Wakatime/Komarev badges? Yeah, they’re like participation trophies for adults. I wear them with pride.  
- **Pinned Repositories:** I don't have any, but I can prove that I am old by this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/wahyusa/e34ed057bac98417b96556cb37933c52)
- **Open Source Contribution:** My first accepted open source contribution pull request actually just moving "period" to last sentence in [GitHub Docs](https://github.com/github/docs/commit/f50aaf6babbdc93f7f6a59119e33685d01cc9ce9)

## 📈 Career Trajectory:
- **2013:** “I’m successfully creating Facebook phising site, hacked more than 10 victim including my friend”  
- **2017:** “I’m join GitHub because I think can host blog site free forever here”  
- **2018:** “Unemployeed”
- **2019 - 2023:** “Bachelor Degree but in COVID events”
- **2024:** “Manipulated by Bootcamp and courses seller”
- **2025:** “Getting old with no experience”

## 🔥 Hot Take:
If you’re looking for someone who’s “been there, done that,” you’ve come to the wrong place. I’ve been there, *tried* that, and then immediately forgot how it worked. My code is a chaotic mess of outdated libraries and questionable design choices. Dirty and pragmatic naive codes. But hey, at least I’m consistent!  

## 🚫 Why Bother Following Me?
- I might accidentally solve a problem someday.  
- I’m great at overcomplicating simple tasks.  
- You’ll feel better about your own productivity.  

## 🕰️ The Cruel Truth:
Getting old in tech is like being a vintage wine—everyone pretends you’re valuable, but deep down, you’re just a dusty bottle of “meh.” I’m here to embrace the chaos, one half-finished project at a time.
