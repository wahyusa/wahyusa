### Hi there 👋

# 🚨 Warning 🚨

Welcome to my GitHub! A digital landfill where projects go to die and my youth fades. Let’s get one thing straight: I’m not “experienced”—I’m just old 😜. Like, *really* old. Old enough to remember when AI is nothing.  

## 📊 Stats That Nobody Cares:
- **Years of Coding:** 9+ (but who’s counting?)  
- **Projects Completed:** 3 (two of which are just “Hello World”).  
- **Lines of Code:** 10,000+ (mostly copy-pasted from Stack Overflow or AI Generated).  
- **Current Skill Level:** Expert at creating basic pragmatic CRUD without thinking much about other edge cases.
- Previously addicted to AI and vibe coding, now I have repented and returned to the right SWE path. 😇

## 🎯 My “Achievements”:
- **Master of Inactivity:** I’ve perfected the art of staring at a blank screen for hours. It’s my superpower.  
- **Badge Collector:** Those Wakatime/Counter badges? Yeah, they’re like participation trophies for adults. I wear them with pride.  
- **Pinned Repositories:** I don't have any, but I can prove that I am old by this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/wahyusa/e34ed057bac98417b96556cb37933c52)
- **Open Source Contribution:** My first accepted open source contribution pull request actually just moving "period" to last sentence in [GitHub Docs](https://github.com/github/docs/commit/f50aaf6babbdc93f7f6a59119e33685d01cc9ce9) also I proud to be initial part of [Astro JS](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/4384) decision to use `npx` instead of `npm run`.

## 📈 Career Trajectory:
- **2013:** “I’m successfully creating Facebook phising site, hacked more than 10 victim including my friend”  
- **2017:** “I’m join GitHub because I think can host blog site free forever here”  
- **2018:** “Unemployeed”
- **2019 - 2023:** “Bachelor Degree but in COVID events”
- **2024:** “Manipulated by bootcamp and course seller”
- **2025:** “Getting old with no experience”
- **Friendly note:** Even though I'm getting old and don't work in the SWE field, I'm glad I can still afford my daily expenses and gacha game top up while keeping tech and programming as my hobbies 🤗 but of course I still try to get better job.
- **FUCK:** SHIT HERE IS THE THING MY MONTHLY SALARY IS IDR 900.000 | I CAN SPENT IDR 300.000 FOR MY NEEDS LIKE GAME AND INTERNET RANDOM SHIT, THE REST ARE THROWN AWAY ONLY TO BUY CAT FOOD FUCKING CAT FOOD ASSHOLE THERE IS 25 CAT IN THE HOUSE FUCK AND THIS FUCKING FAMILY ALWAYS USE MY MONEY FOR THAT FUCKING CAT FOOD HOW THE FUCK I CAN SAVE MONEY FOR FUTURE OR SPECIFIC UPGRADE SO I CAN HAVE A FUCKING WORKING DEVICE TO DO FUCKING ZOOM MEETING AND DO THAT FUCKING LEETCODE SHIT INTERVIEW FUCK THIS WORLD BUT OF COURSE I AM WRONG, THE STUPIDEST PERSON IS MYSELF AND I KNOW IT.

## 🔥 Hot Take:
If you’re looking for someone who’s “been there, done that,” you’ve come to the wrong place. I’ve been there, *tried* that, and then immediately forgot how it worked. My code is a chaotic mess of outdated libraries and questionable design choices. Dirty and pragmatic naive codes. But hey, at least I’m consistent!

Taylor Otwell once said Gen Z especially in Laravel field might not be able to do in depth backend development, they don't know or understand about cache, queue, databases and so on. Well, it was true! just like me. I don't know maybe people should give junior or intern a chance but with detailed workflow, gitflow, code review rules, convention and mentor. But I know most companies are just don't have time and resource to do that.

## 🚫 Why Bother Following Me?
- I might accidentally solve a problem someday.  
- I’m great at overcomplicating simple tasks.  
- You’ll feel better about your own productivity.  

## 🕰️ The Cruel Truth:
Getting old in tech is like being a vintage wine—everyone pretends you’re valuable, but deep down, you’re just a dusty bottle of “meh.” I’m here to embrace the chaos, one half-finished project at a time.
